# ExplorationActivity1

## Introduction
My name is Daphne Dairo-Singerr, and for my first exploration acitivity, I created a small interactive game using the Selenium library in Python. This game includes content from the Five Nights at Freddy's horror game. Please read the _Before You Play_ section before running the game:

## Before You Play
- Make sure you have headphones connected to your device. 
  - Please have the volume at a decent level. Nothing too loud.
    - **This game does not include loud sounds, but make sure you can hear a Youtube video at a comfortable volume.**
- You will need to switch between your terminal to enter input and the automated Chrome window.
- When the automated Chrome window is running, do not click anything on the window.
  - Only click on the automated Chrome window when your terminal asks to do so.
- This game is Five Nights at Freddy's related. 
  - For those who do not know FNAF, it is a horror video game series. 
  - **Do not worry, there are no jumpscares or loud sounds included in this interactive game.**
- You will need to know how each of the FNAF 1 animatronics look. Click [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CPBRvkJwlZiilyfd1J26oExbrE29KRmt?usp=sharing) to see them.
  - **Again, there is nothing scary included in the above link.**
  - All media is included within a Google Drive link, so you will only see what is needed to be seen for **this** game.

### Which package/library does the sample program demonstrate?
As stated in the introduction, this sample program demonstrates the Selenium library using Python. A brief explanation is that Selenium is used for web test automation. 

### How does someone run your program?
Follow the listed steps below:
- Under the ![Code](/media/code_button.png) button on GitHub, click **Download Zip**
- Extract the .zip file contents into your Downloads folder on your device for simplicity.
- If using the Terminal:
  - Change to the project directory:
    - In your terminal, first type `cd Downloads/explor`, then press the **Tab** button on your keyboard and hit **Enter**.
    - You should now be in the project directory.
  - In the terminal, type `pip3 install selenium` to install the selenium library.
  - Type `python3 main.py` to run the program.
- If using an IDE:
  - Open the project folder in the **Downloads** directory (**File -> Open Folder**).
  - In the IDE terminal, type `pip3 install selenium` to install the selenium library.
  - Run the code on _main.py_.

### What purpose does your program serve?
The purpose of my program is to showcase the basics of Selenium.
This includes:
- Text being typed
- Images being clicked
- Videos being played
- Navigating to a different website
Also, my program serves for a source of entertainment. I wished to implement a way for the user to also interact with the program and not just sit and wait as it runs.

### What would be some sample input/output?
Throughout the game, you will be asked to type either one or two characters in the terminal. Without spoiling anything, your choices will either lead to the _good_ or _bad_ ending. The inputs you can choose from will be listed in your terminal:
```
