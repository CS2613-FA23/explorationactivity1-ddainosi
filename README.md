## Introduction
My name is Daphne Dairo-Singerr, and for my first exploration acitivity, I have created a small interactive game using the Selenium library in Python. This game includes content from the Five Nights at Freddy's horror game. Please read the _Before You Play_ section before running the game:

## Before You Play
- Make sure you have headphones connected to your device. 
  - Please have the volumn at a decent level. Nothing too loud.
    - **This game does not include loud sounds, but make sure you can hear a Youtube video at a normal volumn.**
- You will need to switch between your terminal to enter input and the automated Chrome window.
- When the automated Chrome window is running, do not click anything on the window.
  - Only click on the automated Chrome window when your terminal asks to do so.
- This game is Five Nights at Freddy's related. 
  - For those who do not know FNAF, it is a horror video game series. 
  - **Do not worry, there are no jumpscares or loud sounds included in this interactive game.**
- You will need to know how each of the FNAF 1 animatronics look. Click [here]() to see them.
  - **Again, there is nothing scary included in the above link.**
  - All media is included within a Google Drive link, so you will only see what is needed to be seen for **this** game.


### Which package/library does the sample program demonstrate?
As stated in the introduction, this sample program demonstrates the Selenium library using Python. A brief explanation is that Selenium is used for web test automation. 

### How does someone run your program?
Follow the listed steps below:
- Under the green code button (show a pic), click **Download Zip**
- Extract the .zip file contents into your Downloads folder on your device for simplicity.
- On your terminal, change to the project directory:
  - In your terminal, type 'cd Downloads' and hit **Enter**.
  - You should now be in the Downloads directory. In your Terminal, now type 'cd explora' then press the **Tab** button on your keyboard and hit **Enter**.
- You should now be in the project directory. Type 'python3 main.py' to run the program.
- If using an IDE, open the project folder in the **Downloads** directory (**File -> Open Folder**).
- Run the code on _main.py_.

### What purpose does your program serve?
The purpose of my program is to showcase the basics of Selenium.
This includes:
- Text being typed
- Images being clicked
- Videos being played
- Navigating to a different website

### What would be some sample input/output?
Throughout the game, it will ask you to type either one or two characters in the terminal. Without spoiling anything, your choices will either lead to the _good_ or _bad_ ending. The inputs you can choose from will be listed in your terminal.
