# Overview
The library I chose for my first exploration activity was Selenium. I showcased some of the uses for the library using Python.

## Personal Overview
I selected Selenium because it was my favourite aspect from my previous co-op. I had fixed automation test cases to ensure the correct web elements were being selected. Since I had a lot of fun with the project, I wanted to study the library again but use it with a different language. Previously, I used Selenium with Java, but the only difference is the syntax. Locating web elements functions in the exact same way.

Learning Selenium helped me understand Python’s syntax more. With test automation, there are many ways for something to go wrong as in an element not being found in time, so I was introduced to how exception handling worked in Python to catch the TimeOut and NoSuchElement exceptions. Additionally, having testing websites through automation usually doesn’t involve user input. However, since I wanted to create a mini interactive game, I was able to find a way to implement user input in a simple way with a library that is strictly used for testing web features without any interaction from the user. It was satisfying to be able to mix in some of Python’s basic functions with Selenium’s functions and get the desired result.

As someone who is interested in working in the field of Quality Assurance, I had an overall great time working with the library. Its documentation was very clear, and it was also extremely helpful that I could always find extra resources for any confusions I had while developing the project. However, I did struggle with finding a way to end the program as soon as the videos stopped playing as to just forcing the program to wait a certain of seconds and hope the video would have fully played out. Forcing the program to wait causes an issue because not all networks have the same speed. I noticed that the videos would play quite quickly at home, but it would take longer to load on campus. I would definitely recommend this library to anyone who is interested in learning about QA, specifically about test automation. Just learning the basics as in clicking an element gives one enough knowledge on how it functions. I will continue to use this library as I wish to soon make a website for a personal project. I will use Selenium to help test its features to ensure everything is working as it should and to also delve into its more complex concepts.
